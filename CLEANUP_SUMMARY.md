## 🔧 Major Fixes Applied

### 1. Component Deduplication
- **Toast System**: Removed duplicate toast components, kept comprehensive `/components/ui/Toast.tsx`
- **Dashboard Components**: Eliminated duplicate dashboard implementations
- **Landing Page**: Removed old landing components (AnimatedLogoDemo, VideoLogo, FloatingChat)

### 2. Next.js 15 Compatibility
- ✅ Updated all dynamic routes to use `Promise<{ id: string }>` params
- ✅ Fixed async parameter destructuring in API routes
- ✅ Resolved JSX namespace issues across components

### 3. TypeScript & Prisma Schema Fixes
- ✅ Corrected field name mismatches:
  - `comment.author` → `comment.user`
  - `submission.fileUrl` → `submission.zipPath`
  - `grade.gradedAt` → `grade.createdAt`
  - `enrollment.enrolledAt` → `enrollment.joinedAt`
- ✅ Removed non-existent field references (e.g., `student.lastLoginAt`)
- ✅ Fixed data structure alignment with Prisma schema

### 4. Clean Homepage Implementation
Replaced mixed landing/classroom page with focused classroom system:
```typescript
// Clean Classroom Informatika Homepage
- Hero Section: "Sistem Pembelajaran Classroom Informatika"
- Features: Assignment management, real-time feedback, progress tracking
- Authentication: Integrated login/register flow
- Dashboard Routing: Direct navigation to student/teacher dashboards
```

### 5. API Route Optimization
Removed unnecessary routes and kept only essential classroom functionality:
- ✅ Assignment management APIs
- ✅ Authentication endpoints
- ✅ Class and enrollment management
- ✅ Submission and grading system
- ✅ Comment system for assignments
